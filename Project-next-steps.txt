Okay so basically I have created user CRUD (create, readlist, read single, update, delete, login) now whcih module shoud i start with ?

Edit
Based on your requirements and the fact that you have user CRUD ready, I recommend starting with the Restaurant Management Module next. Here's why and the suggested order:

🎯 Start with: Restaurant Management Module
Why Restaurant Module First?
Core Business Entity - Restaurants are central to your platform
Admin Workflow - You need restaurants registered before customers can order
Foundation for Other Modules - Menu, orders, ratings all depend on restaurants
Testing Ready - You can test with real restaurant data

📋 Restaurant Module Implementation Order:
Phase 1: Basic Restaurant CRUD
✅ Users CRUD (Done)
🔄 Restaurant CRUD:
   → Create restaurant (owner registration)
   → List restaurants (for admin approval)
   → Get single restaurant
   → Update restaurant details
   → Delete/Deactivate restaurant
   → Admin approval workflow (pending → approved/rejected)

Phase 2: Location & Service Areas
→ Buildings CRUD
→ Floors CRUD  
→ Link restaurants to buildings (service areas)
→ Get restaurants serving specific building/floor

Phase 3: Restaurant Operations
→ Restaurant shifts (operating hours)
→ Commission rate configuration
→ Restaurant dashboard basics
🗂️ Complete Module Development Sequence:
✅ Users Module (Done)
🔄 Restaurant Management (Current - Start Here)
🍽️ Menu Management (After restaurants are set up)
📦 Order Management (Core business logic)
💳 Payment Integration (Revenue critical)
⭐ Rating & Review System (User experience)
🎁 Loyalty & Offers (Business growth)
📊 Analytics & Reporting (Business insights)
🚀 Restaurant Module APIs to Build:

For Restaurant Owners:
javascript
POST   /api/restaurants              // Register restaurant
GET    /api/restaurants/:id          // Get own restaurant
PUT    /api/restaurants/:id          // Update restaurant
GET    /api/restaurants/:id/analytics // Basic analytics
For Admins:
javascript
GET    /api/admin/restaurants        // List all restaurants
PUT    /api/admin/restaurants/:id/approve // Approve restaurant
PUT    /api/admin/restaurants/:id/reject  // Reject restaurant
For Customers:
javascript
GET    /api/restaurants              // List approved restaurants
GET    /api/restaurants/:id          // Public restaurant details
GET    /api/buildings/:id/restaurants // Restaurants serving building
💡 Why This Order Makes Sense:
Natural Dependencies - Each module builds on the previous
Testing Flow - You can test incrementally
Business Value - Gets core functionality working first
User Onboarding - Restaurants can start setting up while you build other features
🎯 Quick Win for Restaurant Module:
Start with just the basic restaurant CRUD and admin approval workflow. This gives you:

Restaurant owners can register
Admins can approve/reject
Foundation for menu management
Something tangible to demo
